# Circuit Simulator
*Copyright Â© 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology*

This circuit simulator uses two js libraries: schematic.js for drawing circuits and cktsim.js for solving them.

The libraries have been written by MIT for the [6002x online course](https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu) on the new [MITx](http://mitx.mit.edu) learning platform. I think they will be opensourcing all these libraries, and much more, soon.
